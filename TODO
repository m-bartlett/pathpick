- draw_row and draw_header instead of updating entire page

- selection toggle should trigger draw_row

- selection bullet color-reset gets truncated if file is too long, colorizing the rest of the page

- change subselection appropriately on ascend/descend

- only keep selection leaves marked as "True"

- return selection JSON on filesystem paths

- don't show an empty dir, overwrite the dir name with warning message if attempting to descend into it

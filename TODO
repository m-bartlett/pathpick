[ ] input json for pre-populated selection in interactive session
    [ ] and accept pathlist input?

[ ] how to handle absolute vs relative json output? And input?

[ ] convert between json and pathlist outputs

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
[x] json only outputs true leaves
[x] Makefile
[x] makefile to install as pip or stand alone executable (zip with a hashbang)
[x] ctrl-H to toggle showing hidden directories
[!] LS_COLORS
[x] compare file path lengths before applying ANSI to avoid ANSI-stripping to compare lengths
[x] empty directories don't break everything
[x] ctrl-R to refresh directory
[x] dirs don't check '/' but instead use is_dir
[x] dirs are different colors
[x] opening "empty" dirs crashes
[x] only keep selection leaves marked as "True"
[x] selecting dirs crashes
[x] draw_row and draw_header instead of updating entire page
[x] selection toggle should trigger draw_row
[x] selection bullet color-reset gets truncated if file is too long, colorizing the rest of the page
[x] change subselection appropriately on ascend/descend
[x] return selection JSON on filesystem paths
[x] Pass pathlib.Paths around instead of strings of paths

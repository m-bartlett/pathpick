- LS_COLORS


- ctrl-R to refresh directory

- don't show an empty dir, overwrite the dir name with warning message if attempting to descend into it
    - Make this formatting prettier :)
    
- terminal focus-lose styling?




------------------------------------------------------------------------
- dirs don't check '/' but instead use is_dir
- dirs are different colors
- opening "empty" dirs crashes
- only keep selection leaves marked as "True"
- selecting dirs crashes
- draw_row and draw_header instead of updating entire page
- selection toggle should trigger draw_row
- selection bullet color-reset gets truncated if file is too long, colorizing the rest of the page
- change subselection appropriately on ascend/descend
- return selection JSON on filesystem paths
